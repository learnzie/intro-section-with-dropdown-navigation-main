## The challenge

The challenge is to build out this intro section with dropdown navigation and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
